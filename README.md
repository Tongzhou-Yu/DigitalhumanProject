# Digital Human Project
Thanks for hizzlehoff's facial capture solution: FaceCapOSCReceiver  
https://github.com/hizzlehoff/FaceCapOSCReceiverExample  
    
Using unity 2019.4.8 best   
If not included add the 'extOSC' package via the Unity Asset store  
iPhone X or above for faical capture, and dowdload app "Face Cap"  
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/face-cap-motion-capture/id1373155478    
    
Settings:  
Step 1:  Open the scene "/Scenes/SampleScene".   
Step 2:  Make sure Unity is allowed through your firewall.   
Step 3:  Make sure the FaceCap iOS app and the Unity project are connected to the same wifi network, or even better create a hotspot on you iPhone or iPad and connect the device running Unity to the hotspot via a USB cable.  
Step 4:  Press play in Unity and on the "Actor" gameObject you will find an "extOSC" component that shows the I.P. address of your device, enter this in the Face Cap iOS app live mode.
